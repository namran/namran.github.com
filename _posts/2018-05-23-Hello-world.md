Finally managed to get the github to host my personal site.

This become the notes dump with some code extract.

Looking forward to have more codes or notes.

```php
php_info();
```

apparently the stepping stone to get this jekyll running on github is not so straight forward.

I would suggest you to use minima theme first.
